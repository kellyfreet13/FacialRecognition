# FacialRecognition
Contains VGG and Alexnet implementations of facial expression classification.

Also contains the kaggle ship challenge (finding ships in satellite imagery) preprocessing. We 'abandoned ship' due to memory issues.
<br />

This also contains a Cat vs. Dog classifier using VGG. The name of this repo is a bit deceiving, I know.
